\section{{bigRreg}}
\label{S:bigRreg}

As mentioned previously, we are developmenting several different implemenations of the rank-based methods discussed in Section~\ref{S:bigData_scores}.
In this section we discuss an implementation, in development, which uses \verb|biglm| \citep{biglm}.  
At the time of writing, this implmentation only calls \verb|biglm| to compute the projection once per iteration; i.e., does not process the projection in steps.\footnote{An implementation which processes the projection in chunks seems possible but would require a number of modifications to the current code.  Advanced R users with experience implementing out of memory regression using \texttt{biglm} may be able to modify the code (under GPL) for an out of memory solution rank-based regression solution.}
